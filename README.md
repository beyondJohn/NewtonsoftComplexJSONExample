# NewtonsoftComplexJSONExample
## How to create a complex JSON object using Newtonsoft Json.NET
- The code herein is written as a .netCore application
- More specifcally the code is of type .netCore WebAPI
- CORS reference exists in code but should be deleted if CORS is not being used
## The code will produce the following JSON object
{"location":{"1":{"lat":"67678967","lng":"s9907897"},"2":{"lat":"67895645","lng":"0989435"},"3":{"lat":"3245","lng":"79763"},"4":{"lat":"3245","lng":"79763"}}}
- The code was developed to store GPS coordinates
- You may notice that the Latitude and Longitude values are not real values and only provided for testing purposes

Json.NET is powerful but not easy to work with, but MOST importantly it works well with .netCore

BTW, .netCore is AWESOME
